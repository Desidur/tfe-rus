 bm_476_ravenna_desc:1 "On the 4th of September, 476 CE, an army of Foederati under the command of Odoacer breached the walls of the Western Roman capital at Ravenna and forced Emperor Romulus Augustulus to abdicate, ending Roman rule over Western Europe and leaving Afrianus of Soissons, Nepos of Illyria, and Zenon of the Eastern Roman Empire as the last rulers left trying to preserve Roman rule and influence.\n\nAs one of the last remaining Roman strongholds in the west, Soissons is beset on all sides by the Visigoths, Alans, Burgundians, and the Franks, whilst Illyria's ruler maintains his claim on the crown of the former empire. Meanwhile, in Italia itself, Odoacer has established a new power in the form of the Kingdom of Italy, while contending with the Vandals in the Mediterranean and Illyria on the opposite shore of the Adriatic.\n\n#bold The eagle has fallen in Western Europe - who will succeed in creating a legacy as profound as that of the Eternal City's empire?#!" #NT!

 bookmark_ravenna_zeno_desc:0 "Zeno was Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire from 473 to 475 AD, and a second time from 476 until his death in 491 AD. During his reign, he was forced to contend with civil unrest and religious controversies. He also ruled through the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the rise of Odoacer's Italian kingdom as a Roman client state. \n\n#Bold By the time of his death in 491, the Eastern Roman Empire had become more stable and future emperors would continue to interfere in the affairs of a Western Europe now bereft of a Roman Empire. Will your reign be just as stable, or will your luck match Zeno's unfortunate dice throw in his infamous tabula game in 480 AD?#!" #NT!

After reneging on his client status, Odoacer was forced to contend with Rugian and Ostrogothic invasions between 487 and until his assassination in 493 AD.\n\n#bold Can Odoacer establish a new empire on the ruins of the old?

Despite his best efforts to uphold Western Roman authority, Nepos was forced into exile in Dalmatia after he failed to properly defeat the Visigoths and when his ally, Zeno, was briefly overthrown. After relocating to Dalmatia, Nepos continued to be seen as the legitimate Western Emperor until his murder in 480 AD. \n\n#bold Can he restore the Western Roman Empire, or will he perish as the dying breath of the fallen eagle?#!" #NT!

Throughout his reign, the Vandals infamously sacked Rome in 455, went on to establish a formidable naval power in the former province of Africa, and signed a peace treaty with Eastern Rome which lasted until 530 AD. \n\n#Bold With the west continuing to crumble and the east placated, can Genseric and his heirs uphold their already-impressive legacy?#!" #NT!
