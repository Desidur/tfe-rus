 bookmark_apostate_julian_desc:0 "Julian II was Imperator of the Roman Empire from 361 until his untimely death in 363 AD. A half-nephew of Constantine the Great, Julian differed from his relatives in one way; religion. Having abandoned Christianity, Julian instead embraced the empire's once prominent Hellenic pantheon, granting him the epithet, 'The Apostate' among his Christian opponents. \n\n#bold In 363 AD, Julian died during a disastrous campaign against the Sassanid Empire, going down in history as the last pagan ruler of the Roman Empire. Can you do something different?" #NT!
