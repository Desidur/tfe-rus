 bm_476_old_north_desc:1 "When Emperor Claudius commenced his invasion of Britain in 43 AD, he started a gradual process that led to the Roman Empire dominating the political and cultural dynamics of the British Isles through the creation of a new imperial province: Britannia.\n\nHowever, times have changed since Britain first came under the banner of the Imperial eagle. As the Western Roman Empire has collapsed under the pressure of foreign invaders and internal struggles, Britannia has largely been forgotten due to a lack of direct rule from Mediolanum or Ravenna for decades, and the unclear future for the rump states of Soissons and Dalmatia have made the British Isles far less important as opposed to the affairs of the European mainland.\n\n#bold The former province is now a battleground between different polities, cultures, and faiths, and only one can emerge victorious to reshape the destiny of the British Isles..." #NT!

However, waves of Saxons and Jutes now threaten Britannia and Ambroisus' family. As King of the Britons, he now assumes the title of Dux and has sworn to protect his homeland from these foreigners.
