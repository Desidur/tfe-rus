 bm_395_promising_rulers_desc:1 "Through the division of the Roman Empire between east and west, the full extent of Roman vulnerability has been made transparent.\n\nWithin the Western Roman Empire, the Salian Franks cling to the southern shores of the Rhine River, serving as foederati to the government centered in Mediolanum. Deep in the heart of Roman civilization, the competent and patriotic Flavius Stilicho only seeks the best course of action for the safety and survival of the empire.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Eastern Roman Empire, the Visigoths under Alaric have begun a rampage across the Balkan provinces, looting many cities and sowing chaos throughout the land. Angered by years of his people being persecuted and used in the Romans' internal wars, Alaric has recently been proclaimed as king and is intent on fulfilling his march for vengeance against the Eternal City.\n\n#bold In this climate of political tension and unrest, could one of these leaders supplant the line of Theodosius 'The Great?'" #NT!

 bookmark_promising_rulers_stilicho_desc:0 "Flavius Stilicho was a prominent general of Romano-Vandalic origin who protected the Roman Empire from internal and external forces through both his military experience and his diplomatic skill. Despite steering Western Rome away from certain doom on multiple occasions at the height of his career, he was eventually murdered in 408 AD under suspicion of collaborating with the Visigoths.\n\n#bold Stilicho's death contributed to the weak response to Alaric's Sack of Rome in 410 AD. Can you lead both the Roman world and Stilicho's line toward greatness instead?" #NT!

After he entertained the possiblity of bringing Africa under the banner of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Western Roman Senate (at the behest of Stilicho) declared him an enemy of Rome. Gildo eventually lost in his revolt against the Western Roman Empire and died under mysterious circumstances in 398 AD.\n\n#bold Gildo's defeat prevented a grain crisis in Western Rome - can you inflict even greater damage to the beleaguered empire?" #NT!

During his reign, he pillaged the Balkans and infamously sacked the city of Rome in 410 AD, causing the first cracks in the Western Roman Empire's slow process of collapse.\n\n#bold After his death in Southern Italia, he was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Athaulf, who would go on to marry Galla Placidia, the sister of Honorius and Arcadius, and transform the Visigoths into a proper kingdom in Southern Gaul.
