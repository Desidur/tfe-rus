 britannia_struggle.0501.desc:0 "Over the past few decades, the Roman Province of Britannia has become an increasingly isolated part of the empire. Ever since the usurper Magnus Maximus launched his bid for imperial power, Britannia had been stripped of not only a sizeable portion of its garrison, but also any sort of armed band that could protect her, along with many governors and the flower of its youth. Since then, Hadrian's Wall had been bereft of any meaningful garrison and has now served as little more than a landmark for any raid coming from the highlands of Pictland.\n\nFrom across the North Sea, the Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Frisians continuously pillage the coast and bring with them settlers to populate their newly-conquered lands in the British Isles. In the west, the remaining Celts of Hibernia eye our lands with devious intent and already some raids from them have begun anew. With the Western Roman Empire in sharp decline, Britannia is now little more than a battleground fought over between different peoples, cultures, and faiths. Whoever overcomes all challenges the British Isles bring forth will surely lead the region in a new direction.\n\n" #NT!

It so happens that one of his workers had their ragged clothes snag on a hard grey rock deposit in their mine.\n\nThe nobleman now claims he’s found a rich stretch of the rock they used to quarry for building churches in the cities." #NT!
