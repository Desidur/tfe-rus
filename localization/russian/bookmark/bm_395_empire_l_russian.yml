 bm_395_empire_desc:1 "On the 17th of January, 395 AD, Emperor Theodosius 'the Great' passed away, having brought stability back to the empire and bringing an end to paganism's influential role in governance, religion, and culture across the Roman world. The Roman Empire was divided into two, with Honorius inheriting the West and Arcadius inheriting the East. As one emperor is a child under a regency led by Flavius Stilicho and the other is seen as weak and easily manipulated, this bodes poorly for the divided empire . . . \n\nDespite their father's efforts, Honorius and Arcadius are forced to contend with the last remnants of paganism across the two empires, while foreign entities like the Huns and Sassanids compete for dominance against the Roman world. The Franks look toward expanding further into Gallia, while the Visigoths seek retribution for years of grievances committed by the Romans. \n\n#bold Playing as the sons of the late Theodosius, how will you guide the Western and Eastern Roman Empires?#!" #NT!

 bookmark_empire_honorius_desc:0 "Honorius was the first Western Roman Emperor, reigning from 395 until 423 AD when he was succeeded by Joannes. During his reign, the Western Roman Empire was weakened with the government-sanctioned murder of Flavius Stilicho and the Sack of Rome in 410 AD by the Visigoths. \n\n#bold Seen as weak in the eyes of the Roman public, Honorius went down in history with an unfavorable reputation. Can you play the role of Western Roman Emperor more effectively?#!" #NT!

Although his father was of Germanic origin, Stilicho views himself as a Roman, and will do whatever it takes to help the empire survive and weather the storms that hang over her future." #NT!

 bookmark_empire_arcadius_desc:0 "Arcadius was the first Eastern Roman Emperor, reinging from 395 until 408 AD when his son, Theodosius II, succeeded him. During his reign, the Imperial Government pursued harsher measures against paganism as Arcadius himself put a greater emphasis on his piety rather than matters of war or politics. \n\n#bold By his death in 408 AD, his reign was seen as ineffective but relatively stable. Compared to this neutral outcome, can you lead the Eastern Roman Empire differently?#!" #NT!
