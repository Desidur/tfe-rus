To make the Empire more manageable, it needs to be split again, this time into two halves: a Western half centered on Italia, and an Eastern half centered on Constantinople.\n\nThe big question that remains is whether to do this now, or later. On one hand, ruling a united Empire is an overwhelming burden on myself.
