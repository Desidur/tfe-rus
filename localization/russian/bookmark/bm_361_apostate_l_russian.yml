 bm_361_apostate_desc:1 "On the 3rd of November, 361 CE, Flavius Claudius Julianus ascended to the throne as the new Roman Emperor. In contrast to his illustrious half-uncle, Julian opposed the growing influence of Christianity within the Roman Empire, instead seeking to promote Neoplatonic Hellenism as part of his background as a philosopher and an advocate for a return to old Roman traditions. \n\n However, the preceding reigns of Constantine the Great and Constantius II saw Christianity become highly influential, with many officials and administrators having converted to the once-surpressed religion. With several Christian figures already condemning the new emperor as an apostate, Julian's reign is already in a tenuous position. \n\n#bold Harkoning to a nearly-bygone era, will Julian succeed in restoring Hellenic Paganism to its place of prominence and stabilize the Roman Empire once more?" #NT!

 bookmark_apostate_julian_desc:0 "Julian II was Imperator of the Roman Empire from 361 until his untimely death in 363 AD. A half-nephew of Constantine the Great, Julian differed from his relatives in one way; religion. Having abandoned Christianity, Julian instead embraced the empire's once prominent Hellenic pantheon, granting him the epithet, 'The Apostate' among his Christian opponents. \n\n#bold In 363 AD, Julian died during a disastrous campaign against the Sassanid Empire, going down in history as the last pagan ruler of the Roman Empire. Can you do something different?" #NT!
