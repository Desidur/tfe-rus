 VIETceltic.0001.t:0 "Holy Waters" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0001.desc:0 "A hot spring was recently discovered near where I live. Though it is of small size and will never attract the same amount of attention as a larger spring, among the worshippers of the ancient Celtic gods, springs were often believed to be sacred places." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0001.a:0 "Great! I should go there to worship soon." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0002.t:0 "An Offering for [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName]?" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0002.desc:0 "If I wish for success in battle, it would make sense for me to appeal to the gods to do so. Several [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] have told me a good way of doing that is to take some expensive, beautiful equipment, like a masterfully carved shield and helmet, and toss them into a large lake or river in a ceremony. This will surely please [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName]!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0002.a:0 "A good idea! Let's do that." #NT!

 VIETceltic.0003.t:0 "Curses" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0003.desc:0 "One of my servants was caught with a curse tablet addressed to the goddess Sulis. Though an old Britonnic goddess of healing, she also serves as an agent of curses.

 VIETceltic.0003.b:0 "Horrible! My servant needs to be imprisoned." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0004.t:0 "Sirona's Shrine" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0004.desc:0 "While traveling along a small, old dirt road, I pass by a tiny shrine dedicated to a healing goddess, Sirona. I observe the statue of her which stands atop the small altar; she is depicted holding a snake and a bowl of eggs, her symbols. We do not know who made this rudimentary shrine, as there are no inscriptions, but perhaps it was one of the locals living nearby who was a devotee of this goddess." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0004.a:0 "I pray to Sirona and then move on." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0005.t:0 "Sequana" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0005.desc:0 "A couple traveling [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] told me that if I wanted to ensure good health, I should make an offering to Sequana, the Gallic goddess of the river Seine. I am to make an altar to her and offer her several wooden carvings of different body parts and organs, as well as that of ducks, her familiars who are said to be quite playful and rebellious despite their esteemed station. If possible, I should add various luxuries like money or fruit to this offering." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0005.a:0 "My health is fine, so no need to do that for now." #NT!

 VIETceltic.0006.t:0 "Romans and Celts" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0006.desc:0 "I am reading ancient historical accounts of the peoples of Britain and Gaul, who fought off the Roman invaders - sometimes successfully, many times not.\n\nAs I worship the same gods those ancient peoples do, I am their spiritual descendant. It is sad to think they were conquered in such a way. But was it all that bad? Some of our practices were influenced by the Romans, too, which helped enriched our spiritual worldview and connections to the Gods." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0006.a:0 "The Romans were ruthless, bloodthirsty conquerors, nothing more!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0006.b:0 "The ancient Romans and Celts learned much from each other." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0007.t:0 "Gods of the Common Soldier" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0007.desc:0 "I have noticed that many of my soldiers have taken to worshipping the martial deities Belatucadros and Cocidius. They are quite popular among lowly ranked soldiers, but I've considered giving my respects to these two deities more frequently. However, because they are deities of the common masses, it might not look too good in the eyes of my fellow elites." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0007.a:0 "We should respect all deities! I wish to worship them more." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0007.b:0 "Though they are good deities, I am not obliged to worship them." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0008.t:0 "Vosegus' Shrine" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0008.desc:0 "Today I am paying my respects to Vosegus, a hunting god, at a local shrine. I approach the statue of the deity, depicting a man wielding a bow and shield in one hand, and carrying a piglet in the other; he is accompanied by a dog." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0008.a:0 "I offer a votive stone carving with my name on it." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0009.t:0 "Nuts!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0009.desc:0 "While walking outside one day, I and a few of my guards come across a large pile of nuts. It is an odd coincidence, at the very least.\n\nOne of my guards, a superstitious sort, proclaims, "That is no coincidence! It must be a sign from the hunting god, Vosegus, for nuts like these here are his sacred symbol."" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0009.a:0 "If you say so!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0010.t:0 "Eye Irritation" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0010.desc:0 "I am suffering from some odd irritation in my eye. It doesn't seem like a serious affliction, but it is annoying. If I want to make it better, perhaps I should pray to Belenus, god of the sun and healing. It is said he has the power to cure any ailment of the eye, even minor ones like this." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0010.a:0 "No, this is not a major issue." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0010.b:0 "I will offer him fruits and cake." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0010.tooltip:0 "Hopefully, your offering will #P please Belenus#!, and he will help resolve your eye irritation." #NT!

 VIETceltic.0010.message.negative:0 "The eye irritation continues to bother you!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0011.t:0 "Battle in the Sky" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0011.desc:0 "I am at a nearby village and meeting with some of the local leaders. Some of them are telling me about the local folklore.\n\nA well-known story is that once, the settlement was beset by an army of bandits. The defending guards were losing morale, because it looked hopeless. Then, suddenly, everyone saw a manifestation of Belenus, god of the sun and healing, appear in the sky!\n\nAs it looked like this great deity was defending the city from the air, this was a source of great encouragement to the guards, who were able to turn the tide of battle and force the bandits to retreat. For many years afterwards, the village was never bothered by bandits." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0011.a:0 "An interesting tale, but is it really true?" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0011.b:0 "This is a village blessed by Belenus! Amazing!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0012.t:0 "Boann" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0012.desc:0 "Today I am dedicating a small altar out in nature, by a stream, to the goddess Boann, the great river goddess who gave birth to the mighty god Aengus." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0012.a:0 "I hope she will provide me with many blessings!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0013.t:0 "Dream of the Sea" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0013.desc:0 "I saw the deity Manannán, god of the sea, in a dream. I took this as a good sign, so I ordered a craftsman to make me a small carving of a boat, which I buried on the grounds of my property as a sign of thanks." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0013.a:0 "It was a good dream!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0014.t:0 "Atepomarus" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0014.desc:0 "I have come across a small altar of Atepomarus out in the wilderness on my travels. He is one of several Gallic deities of healing, and his symbol is the horse. I notice there are several offerings of figurines of small horses scattered by the foot of the altar." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0014.a:0 "I hope I and my horse shall receive his blessings!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0015.t:0 "Statues" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0015.desc:0 "An acquaintance has gifted me a medium-sized statue of the god Sucellus and Nantosuelta to place as decor in my private rooms.\n\nThis statue of Sucellus portrays him as a bearded man wielding a long hammer in one hand, and a ceramic jar in the other. His consort Nantosuelta holds a miniature house atop a pole in one hand, and a bee hive in the other.\n\nTogether, they will surely bring prosperity into my household!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0015.a:0 "A wonderful gift - thank you!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0016.t:0 "Deadly Eloquence" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0016.desc:0 "Ogmios, or Oghma for the Gaelic pagans, is our deity of strength and eloquence, and was often compared to the Hellenic deity Heracles in ancient times.\n\nI have heard some people find Ogmios a most interesting or even puzzling deity, given how he is typically depicted as looking like an elderly Heracles. However, I feel this shows that strength is more than being a mere brute.\n\nAs a deity of eloquence, Ogmios can convince anyone to do anything. It is an attractive quality, more dangerous than merely knowing how to wrestle or wield a blade!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0016.a:0 "The art of persuasion can be a lethal weapon." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0017.t:0 "Sacred Boar" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0017.desc:0 "A nearby village managed to hunt a great boar. Afterwards, a great feast was held, which I attended given I am the liege of this region. It was a lovely feast, and when we were all done with the feast, the bones of the boar was cremated and its ashes buried nearby in the traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner.\n\nBoars are sacred animals of the Celtic gods, and good sacrifices of these creatures are said to confer many blessings on worthy hunters and warriors." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0017.a:0 "The boar meat was so delicious!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0017.b:0 "I hope I was bestowed with good blessings!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0018.t:0 "Shoemakers' Patron" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0018.desc:0 "While visiting a nearby town, I note that the local shoemakers are making a grand offering to the deity Lugh today at the town's sacred grove. Lugh is, besides being the deity of trade and the arts, the patron of shoemakers, and is quite popular with them." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0018.a:0 "Continue on with my business." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0018.b:0 "Observe the offerings being made." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0019.t:0 "Offering to Lugh" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0019.desc:0 "Today I am offering a votive inscription to Lugh, the great god of trade, prosperity, and the arts. He is popular among many people, so I hope he will bless me as well. I recite, "I swear to Lugh with my right hand," before I give the offering." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0019.a:0 "Praise be to Lugh." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0020.t:0 "Tree Veneration" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0020.desc:0 "There is a lone tree not too far from my house, which a number of [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] say is clearly a sacred tree, where dwells a number of spirits. Such trees, when found by followers of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] way, are to be venerated and given regular offerings. It is a beautiful tree, and probably an old one too, judging by its majestic size." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0020.a:0 "Very well, I will perform regular offerings as needed." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0020.b:0 "I should build a small altar around the tree to honor it!" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0021.t:0 "Taranis" #NT!
 VIETceltic.0021.desc:0 "With a few of my courtiers around me, I toss into the river the little stone carved into the shape of the wheel. We had gathered here today to offer our prayers to Taranis, the old Celtic god of Thunder, whose symbol is the wheel." #NT!
 VIETceltic.0021.a:0 "Let us hope he blesses us today!" #NT!
