 bm_395_middle_east_desc:1 "For centuries, the Romans and Iranians have fought one another for supremacy over the Near East. Now, the Eastern Roman Empire and the House of Sassan find themselves at odds over the region once again.\n\nThe Sassanids have long sought to restore the former might of Persia under the Achaemenids, and have successfully brought peoples like the Lakhmids and the Armenians under their fold. The Eastern Romans followed suit in establishing the Tanukhids and Jafnids as tributary states, and now set their eyes on the independent kingdoms of the Caucasus Mountains. Another contender in the region, the Axumites, look to dominate Himyar along the opposite shores of the Red Sea.\n\n#bold The riches of the Near East have brought two great empires and several outlying kingdoms into a centuries-long struggle. Will one of these empires emerge victorious, or will one of the many underdogs surrounding them repel their ambitions instead?#!" #NT!
