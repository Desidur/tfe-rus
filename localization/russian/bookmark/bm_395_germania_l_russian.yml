 bm_395_germania_desc:1 "Ever since the early expansion of the Roman Republic and Empire, relations between the sons and daughters of the Eternal City and the tribes inhabiting Germania have never been peaceful or ever mutual; the Romans would attack and decimate Germanic settlements, whilst the "barbarians" returned the favor by raiding Roman territory. Now that the Roman Empire is divided and weakened, the lands across the Rhine and the Danube are ripe for conquest, and ripe for many opportunities at avenging those who fell under the Roman heel. \n\n#bold As tribes by the likes of the Visigoths, the Franks, and the Lombards embark on their new paths, will they truly be able to leave their mark in this new age?#!" #NT!
