 germanic_events.0002.desc:0 "After years of division, the Franks can at last be considered a unified peope much like the Visigoths and the Burgundians. With both sides of the Rhine River united under a single banner, a new era dawns upon the Kingdom of the Franks!" #NT!

 germanic_events.0003.desc:0 "For centuries, the Romans had greedily kept the fertile lands of Gaul under their control. It was only through Roman weakness that we were allowed to settle the province's northern frontiers as the empire's foederati. The Western Roman Empire has recently collapsed, and the last remaining vestiges of Roman authority in the west is the Domain of Soissons\n\n The rule over Soissons is already a fragile one, with the domain beset on all sides by forces hostile to a Roman-governed polity. As we were the first of the Germanic tribes to settle in Gaul, our claim over the region is strongest and it is time to lay Roman rule to rest in Western Europe." #NT!

 germanic_events.0005.desc:0 "As we settle in our new and fertile lands, we must secure our borders from all sides. That especially includes the northern border and our newly conquered lands. The new Frankish kingdom in the north will probably not be satisfied with their part of Gaul and them pushing southwards is a real possibility.

The self-proclaimed King of Italy had violated his duty as a client ruler when he marched against the Emperor, and now we are summoned to take away the Italian crown for ourselves. \n\nDominion over the former Roman heartland will grant us more prestige and power than the other Germanic successor states, but undertaking such an invasion on behalf of Constantinople will be looked down upon by the Ostrogothic Kingdom's subjects." #NT!

It is clear, however, that [italy_holder_dissent.GetName] has other ideas and has been trying to slowly chip away at our influence in Italia. This time, however, [italy_holder_dissent.GetSheHe] has gone beyond his limits! My loyal vicars have come to me with news that [italy_holder_dissent.GetName] has sent his followers to sow dissent in our empire!\n\n This is a clear example of treason and should be handled as such!
