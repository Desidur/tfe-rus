 kushan.0001.desc:0 "Long ago, the four great empires of China, Persia, Rome, and the Kushans lived along the Silk Road - sometimes in harmony, sometimes in conflict. Then, everything changed when the Hunnic tribes attacked. The once formidable Kushans became a shadow of their former selves and collapsed into obscurity.\n\nSuch a trajectory of decline, however, is changing.\n\nA certain [kushan_restorer.GetFirstName] has proclaimed [kushan_restorer.GetHerselfHimself] ruler of a restored Kushan Empire. Whether through military might, cunning diplomacy, legal inheritance, or other means, [kushan_restorer.GetSheHe] controls much of the former Kushan Empire and believes that [kushan_restorer.GetSheHe] is continuing the legacy of the great Kushans, even styling [kushan_restorer.GetHerselfHimself] as a great "King of Kings" in the old Kushan manner.\n\nThere is no doubt that [kushan_restorer.GetTitledFirstName] seeks to not only reclaim the Kushans' former glory, but perhaps to even exceed it. How long will the Kushans endure this time?" #NT!
