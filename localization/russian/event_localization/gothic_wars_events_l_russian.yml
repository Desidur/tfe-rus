 gothic_wars_0001.t:0 "King of the Goths" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0001.desc:0 "We have been encamped for what must be 30 years. What was once a fortified camp with organized guards, watch positions, traders, and armories has now declined into a camp of refugees focusing on survival. This, however, is about to change, for a trader from Constatinople has brought news about the current state of the Roman Empire: Emperor Theodosius has passed away and the empire has been partitioned between his two sons. At first I could not believe it. Are we free now? What does this mean for me and my people?\n\nAfter I collected my thoughts, I knew what we had to do. What I had to do.\n\n"We Goths have been slaves to the Romans for years! They used us! They sent us into their wars! And for what? NOTHING! They gave us no citizenship, no food, not even land to settle! They treat us like cattle sent to the slaughter. This has to end! This is our chance to strike back, when they are weak!. Our warriors outnumber theirs and our wrath shall destroy their armies and burn their cities! We must rise up and fight for our freedom and what we and our children deserve!"\n\nAfter my speech, I look at the crowd that has formed around me. Slowly they start chanting:\n\n"King of the Goths! King of the Goths! King of the Goths!"" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0001.a:0 "By [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], the world will kneel before us!" #NT!

 gothic_wars_0002.t:0 "Victory For The Goths" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0002.desc:0 "With large swaths of the Balkan territories now lying in ruins, we have pushed the Imperial government into a difficult position. We've made our grievances known with our Balkan Campaign, and now we are left with an important decision. \n\nWe can pressure the government in Constantinople to formally grant us an office within the empire. The government's refusal, however, might trigger a civil conflict and the Balkans will be forced to bear witness to another war upon their lands . . . \n\n. . . or we can find solace in the treasures we have gathered from the cities across Hellas, Thrace, and Dacia. This path might be seen as an act of mercy upon the Balkans, for they clearly know the cost of doing wrong against the Goths and have rightfully suffered for it." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0002.a:0 "Why stop at treasures when Constantinople can offer more?" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0002.option.a.tooltip:0 "You will demand an office from the emperor. If declined, a civil war will start." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0002.b:0 "Gold and jewels shall suffice" #NT!

 gothic_wars_0003.t:0 "The Demand" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0003.desc:0 "It was assumed that the Goths under Alaric would surely stop at the loot they've gathered from our cities in the Balkan territories, but now they have set us on a precipice by demanding an office within the empire! While some war hawks within the Senate and Imperial Court pressure us into a hardline stance against the barbarians, others have righfully pointed out the situation within the Eastern Roman Empire: \n\nMany of our cities in Hellas, Thrace, and Dacia lay in ruins, their garrisons have been thoroughly crushed, and the treasures of the Balkans are currently held by Alaric and his Goths! With other threats being made apparent in the Huns to the north and the Sassanids in the east, we simply cannot preoccupy ourselves with a civil war. All of this, however, rests in our hands, and we have to make a difficult decision in the face of this impending crisis . . ." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0003.a:0 "What choice do we have?" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0003.b:0 "We will never kneel to these barbarians!" #NT!

 gothic_wars_0004.t:0 "Constantinople Concedes!" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0004.desc:0 "As anticipated, the government in Constantinople has conceded to our demands, granting us an office over the western territories of the Dacian province. With our lands now lying at the border of the Western Roman Empire, we are now in a prime position to enact vengeance upon the arrogant Romans and their cruelty towards our people. And what better act of vengeance is there other than laying waste to the spiritual heartland of the Roman world? \n\nSoon enough, the corruption within Mediolanum will prove to be the undoing of Western Rome. They will be incapable of defending their own heartland, or even the Eternal City herself!" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0004.a:0 "Soon, the Eternal City shall face our wrath!" #NT!

 ### Invasion of Radagaisus, 405-406 - Hróð #NT!
 gothic_wars_0012.t:0 "Gothic Invasion of Italia" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0012.desc:0 "There have recently been rumors of a Gothic king named Radagaisus slaughtering his way across the Pannonian Basin, pillaging and plundering all in his path. Today, these rumors have been proven true. Radagaisus has arrived on the borders of Illyricum Pannoniae, marching his vast armies across the Danube in a bid to conquer all of Italia. May God save the Romans, for we cannot." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0012.a:0 "This is worrying." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0013.desc:0 "We have received reports that a Gothic King by the name of Radagaisus has arrived on the borders of Illyricum Pannoniae with a large force marching behind him, refusing all offers of diplomacy. His men are already crossing the River Danube in large droves and have proceeded to commit atrocities against the land's people, fields, and settlements. \n\nIt is evident that Radagaisus intends to conquer Italia and to destroy all that makes the peninsula the traditional heart of the Roman world. We must make our stand, lest Rome fall mercy to his brutal machinations!" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0013.a:0 "Rome shall not fall!" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0014.desc:0 "Rome has fallen! The barbarian King Radagaisus has broken our armies and taken Italia, displacing thousands of our citizens! We must reclaim the city and our honor, and protect our people from the tyrannical rule of these pagans!" #NT!
 gothic_wars_0014.a:0 "We will avenge Rome." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0015.desc:0 "A large band of Goths originating in the Pannonian Basin gathered under a local warrior named Radagaisus, and marched on Rome. Their invasion has failed, and their armies were routed. Now, the survivors are seeking refuge within our realm, and bring with them an opportunity to take Italia for ourselves, although accepting them would obviously displease both Emperors." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0015.a:0 "They are Goths, so they may stay." #NT!
 gothic_wars_0015.b:0 "They threaten the peace, we cannot let them stay." #NT!
