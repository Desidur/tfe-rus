 bm_361_eastern_huns_desc:1 "The Kushan realm that once stretched across the Silk Road, and stood proudly alongside Rome, Persia, India, and China as one of the great empires of antiquity, is no more. In its wake, new peoples fill in the power vacuum.\n\nForemost of these peoples are the Iranian or Eastern Huns, also known in India as the Hunas, who consist of several groups like the Xionites and Hephthalites. They now occupy many lands formerly ruled by the Kushans, and conflict between them and the established powers in Persia, India, and Central Asia over the riches and trade routes of the Silk Road is inevitable." #NT!

 bookmark_eastern_huns_kidara_desc:0 "Kidara is the first major ruler of the Kidarite Huns, who were named after him. Following the Kushans' decline, he founded the Kidarite Empire in the old Kushan territories of Tokharistan and Gandhara. By claiming the title of #italic Kushanshah#!, he effectively declared himself the official successor of the once mighty Kushans.\n\n#bold The Kidarites were the first of several major waves of Hunnic invasions into Persia and India. How will you set an example for the rest to follow?" #NT!

 bookmark_eastern_huns_kipunada_desc:0 "If Kipunada's ancestors could see the pitiful rump state he rules, they would surely weep. As the last attested Kushan ruler, he was a far cry from his illustrious forebears: a mere petty warlord, ruling a few territories around Taxila, he was subservient to the Guptas and had little power.\n\n#bold Kipunada may have been the last Kushan ruler in history, but it doesn't have to be that way. Can you overcome the odds and restore the Kushans to their former glory?" #NT!

During his 70-year reign, he expanded Sassanid power to even greater heights, waging successful wars against the Romans, Indians, and Arabs. However, the Eastern Huns may prove to be one of his greatest foes yet.\n\n#bold As he enters his twilight years, Shapur II surely worries about what will happen to his empire after he passes away. Will his heirs resist the rising tide of the Huns?" #NT!

Never since the days of the Mauryas was there such a splendorous, mighty empire in India. After his death, the Gupta empire would continue to grow and reach its zenith under his son, Chadragupta II.\n\n#bold The Guptas are in the ascendancy.

Hun chieftains like Zirt played a role in the ever-changing, dynamic politics of the region's nasceant Hunnic tribes.\n\n#bold Zirt would fade into obscurity, remembered only thanks to numismatist scholars who discovered his decrepit coinage. Can you instead make him a ruler who will be remembered for generations?" #NT!
