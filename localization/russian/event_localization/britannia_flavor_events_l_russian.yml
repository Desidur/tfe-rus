 britannia_flavor.0001.desc:0 "A messenger came to me this afternoon with interesting news from [kent.GetNameNoTier].\n\nHe said that one of those self-claimed Roman noblemen tried opening up a new silver mine around Maegdanstane - a rock-speaking fool. It just so happens that one of his workers had their ragged clothes snag on this hard grey rock deposit in their mine. The nobleman now claims he’s found a rich stretch of the rock that they used to quarry for building churches in the cities.\n\nPerhaps something can and should be done to benefit from this ragstone, as they call it." #NT!

My men say these instead belong to the wyrms of the world, who spit fire and ravage the lands." #NT!
