 bm_532_reconquest_desc:1 "It has been five decades since the loss of Italia. The lands, once undivided extensions of Rome, are now in the hands of pretenders claiming to be successors to the Roman Empire. These Goths and the rest of the barbarians rule each over their limited domains. Five years have passed since a new emperor ascended to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire - Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled and with the help of his talented generals, Justinian has triumphed over his Sassanian rivals in the battle of Dara and revised Roman law in its entirety. Recently, Justinian faced and crushed a revolt against him; victorious, Justinian's ambitions are rekindled. The empire's goal and purpose are now clear - the reclamation of the entirety of Rome and the restoration of an era now regarded as the days of the good emperors. \n\n#bold Will the Romans triumph, earning their leaders the nickname "Last of the Romans"? Or will they truly be the last Romans?#!" #NT!

 bookmark_reconquest_belisarius_desc:0 "From a young age Belisarius has been present on the field of battle, from numerous campaigns against the Visigoths in Iberia to his great triumph over the Sassanian army in Dara. Belisarius proved to be a very capable soldier and commander; he crushed the Nika Riots, saving Justinian's rule while leading no more then 300 soldiers against a rabid crowd of 30,000. Justinian summoned Belisarius to the palace and shared his grand vision for conquest - the Roman Empire, restored to its full extent. Pursuant to this, Justinian has tasked Belisarius with leading an expedition to reclaim Africa from the Vandals. On his way out of the palace, a eunuch accompanied Belisarius, saying: \n\n#bold 'You are the last of the great commanders and your loyalty, clearly above question. However... what's left of the Western Empire is wild and unpredictable. A man might look about him and think, perhaps, that it is all rightfully his.'#!" #NT!
