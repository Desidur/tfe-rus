In the shadow of the fallen Kushans, new waves of nomads sweep across the land, such as the Eastern Huns and the Turks.\n\nThough [GetGeographicalRegion('TFE_eastern_iranian_struggle_region').GetName] is currently a chaotic battleground of various polities, cultures, and faiths, the Silk Road has always been a dynamic region. In this arena of war, commerce, and politics, there are always opportunities for those who know how to seize them." #NT!
