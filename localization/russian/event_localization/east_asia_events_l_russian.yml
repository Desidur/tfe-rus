 liang.0010.desc:0 "[previous_holder.GetFullName] is no longer the governor of Dunhuang. I've been the temporary caretaker governor while Dunhuang’s officials discuss who should succeed [previous_holder.GetHerHim]. Many favor [li_gao.GetFullName], who has been involved in the local administration for years and is an individual of many talents. Furthermore, he is said to be virtuous, benevolent, popular among the people, as well as wise and firm in his dealings.\n\nThe official and mystic sorcerer, [guo_nen.GetFullName], a friend of [li_gao.GetFirstName], once prophesied that when a mare bears a pony with a white forehead, [li_gao.GetFirstName] will found an independent state and ensure that his clan will achieve untold glory for generations. Recently, such a pony was reported to have been born nearby.\n\nThe [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_liang').GetName] has been engulfed in strife and conflict like much of the Middle Kingdom. Could [li_gao.GetFullNameNoTooltip] or his descendants be the ones destined to put an end to this chaos?" #NT!

 liang.0011.desc:0 "I had scarcely received word that [previous_holder.GetFullName] is no longer governing Dunhuang when a messenger arrived from the caretaker governor, [governor.GetFullName], and various officials, bearing an important and clear message: due to my popularity and virtue, they think I should become the governor of Dunhuang.\n\nI now recall a prophecy my old friend, the mystic [guo_nen.GetFullName], once told me years ago: “You will one day found an independent state. This will happen when a mare bears a pony with a white forehead.” He added that my descendants will achieve unmatched glory and honor, too.\n\nThough a good man, [guo_nen.GetFirstName] was always an odd one, who frightened some with his sorcerer’s ways. But though he is a bit crazy, I have heard that such a pony was recently born nearby. Has the time come for the House of Li to ascend to greatness?" #NT!

# Li Ling descent flavor #NT!
 steppe.0001.t:0 "Descendants of Li Ling" #NT!
 steppe.0001.desc:0 "Centuries ago, during the Han Dynasty of China, there was a great Han general by the name of Li Ling. His grandfather, Li Guang, was so feared by the Xiongnu they called him the Flying General.\n\nLi Ling, however, was defeated by the Xiongnu, and made to serve them. The Xiongnu ruler, the #italic Chanyu#!, even gave him his daughter’s hand in marriage. Nonetheless, Li Ling was ashamed at his betrayal, and it is said he often had dreams of his homeland, his family, and his Han people. Many years after his defeat, he passed away in a foreign land.\n\nThere has been much speculation about who Li Ling’s descendants are, for they surely carry the sorrow of their tragic ancestor in their hearts. Now, [li_ling_claimant.GetTitledFirstName] has provided evidence that [li_ling_claimant.GetHerHis] clan, the [li_ling_claimant.GetDynasty.GetName], are in fact Li Ling’s progeny. Though this is questioned by some, this claim brings much honor and glory to [li_ling_claimant.GetHerHis] clan: they are Li Ling’s scions, born of Chinese culture and the nomads’ strength!" #NT!
